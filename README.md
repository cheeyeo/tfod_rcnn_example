### Faster-RCNN using TFOD

[LISA Traffic signs dataset]: http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html


Apply fine-tuning to a trained Faster-RCNN object detection model via the TFOD API.


### Dataset

The dataset in use is the [LISA Traffic signs dataset]. The dataset consists of 47 different USA traffic sign types. There are 7855 individual annotations. The training images were taken from a dashcam footage with varying levels of quality and resolution.

To limit the amount of resources required for training, we will only be using 3 traffic sign types for training: **stop sign, pedestrian crossing, signal ahead signs**
